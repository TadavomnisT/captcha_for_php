# Image captcha for php

Hey there!

I've scripted a few captchas so I decided to share them with you.
The first 2 are not really gonna help you with anything but learning how to develope your own captcha!
I recommend you to use third one (antiOCRcaptcha), though it's still in procces of debugging but works fine with less than 10 characters.
You can also help me to develope it.

## Usage
* Simply just use :
```php
    if (!file_exists('captcha.php'))
    copy('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TadavomnisT/captcha_for_php/master/index.php', 'captcha.php');
```
in your script,
Then run 'captcha.php' and you'll find out how it works!
